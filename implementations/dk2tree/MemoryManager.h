 MemoryManager.h:     Purpose    : Improve hash performance.
 Reserves large blocks of memory and gives pointers to small  portions of that block
 when requested. This improves performance since a unique "LARGE ALLOCATION"
 of memory is needed (a unique call to malloc). It is also responsible of freeing memory.
